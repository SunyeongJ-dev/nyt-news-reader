# Module 4 - [Name of your Web Application]

## Instructions
1. You have to commit and push the folder(s) and file(s) in this repo (as you can see that it is an empty repo) so you have to organize all the files and folders as per your requirement.
2. In your README.md, you need to specify how to run the your application locally using npm.
3. You are allowed to use any framework of your choice (if you want but not mandatory) but you can also develop your web application with simple HTML and CSS.
4. There are three milestone(s):
    - **Milestone 0**: It requires that you produce a HTML + CSS mockup for your web app, which will serve as the basis of your web app and will help to direct your strategy and design.
    - **Milestone 1**: You will explore the NYT API (or another API of your choosing) in detail - especially your chosen endpoint - and also the documentation for your chosen third-party library. You will use this to outline a strategy for the development of your web app.
    - **Milestone 2**: Here you will start the coding portion where you will be expected to produce the completed web app.
